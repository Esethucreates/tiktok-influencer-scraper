class OptimizedNoDriver:
    """
    A utility class for creating and managing optimized web browser automation.

    This class helps you control a web browser programmatically (like Chrome) in a way that:
    - Runs faster by disabling unnecessary features
    - Mimics human behavior to avoid detection by websites
    - Provides tools for realistic scrolling and timing

    Think of it as a "robot browser" that can visit websites, scroll pages, and extract
    information while trying to look like a real human user rather than an automated script.

    The class contains only static methods, meaning you don't need to create an instance
    of the class to use it - you can call the methods directly.

        This method returns special command-line arguments (settings) that tell Chrome
        to run in a way that websites are less likely to detect as automated browsing.
        It balances being stealthy (undetectable) with running efficiently.

        Think of these as "disguise settings" for your robot browser - they help it
        blend in with real human users while still running reasonably fast.

        Returns:
            List[str]: A list of Chrome command-line arguments (settings) as text strings.
                      Each string is a specific instruction like '--disable-images'

        The delay time is random between min_delay and max_delay, so it's not
