# TikTok Influencer Discovery Engine

## Overview

The TikTok Influencer Discovery Engine is an automated data collection and analysis system designed to identify and evaluate TikTok influencers for brand partnerships. This Python-based application serves as the core discovery component of a larger influencer marketing platform, specifically targeting small to medium e-commerce businesses seeking quality influencers who align with their brand values and target demographics.

## Business Context

Traditional influencer discovery is a manual, time-intensive process that requires brands to individually search through profiles, analyze engagement metrics, and verify authenticity. This script automates the entire discovery pipeline, transforming what typically takes weeks of manual research into an automated process that delivers qualified influencer candidates with comprehensive performance metrics.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular pipeline architecture:

```
Hashtag Input → Profile Discovery → Content Scraping → Comment Analysis → Data Cleaning → Scoring & Analysis
```

### Core Components

1. **Discovery Module**: Uses targeted hashtags to identify relevant TikTok profiles
2. **Profile Scraper**: Extracts comprehensive profile metadata and bio information
3. **Content Analyzer**: Processes posts to gather engagement and performance data
4. **Comment Processor**: Analyzes comment patterns for audience quality assessment
5. **Data Pipeline**: Cleans, validates, and structures collected data
6. **Scoring Engine**: Calculates influencer qualification metrics

## Technical Stack

- **Browser Automation**: Zendriver for reliable web scraping and navigation
- **Data Processing**: Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and analysis
- **Data Validation**: SQLModel for robust data structure validation and type safety
- **Storage**: JSON-based intermediate storage with planned Supabase database integration
- **Language**: Python 3.x

## Data Collection Points

The system captures comprehensive influencer metrics across multiple dimensions:

### Profile Metrics
- Username and display information
- Follower count and following ratios
- Bio content and contact information availability
- Account verification status and creation date

### Content Performance
- Engagement rates (likes, comments, shares)
- Content categories and hashtag consistence

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Raw Data Collection
- Scrapes profiles identified through hashtag searches
- Collects post metadata and engagement metrics
- Extracts comment threads for audience analysis

### 2. Data Cleaning & Standardization
- Normalizes engagement metrics across different account sizes
- Standardizes date formats and text encoding
- Removes duplicate profiles and invalid data points

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Calculates derived metrics (engagement rates)
- Creates content category classifications

### 4. Validation & Storage
- Applies SQLModel schemas for data consistency
- Validates metric ranges and data types
- Stores processed data in structured JSON format

## Current Development Status

### Production Features
- Hashtag-based profile discovery
- Complete profile and content scraping
- Comment analysis for audience insights
- Multi-dimensional scoring system
- Data cleaning and validation pipeline

### In Development
- **Database Integration**: Migrating from JSON to Supabase for improved data persistence and querying capabilities
- **Architecture Redesign**: Refactoring codebase for better maintainability and open-source preparation
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing concurrent processing for large-scale operations

## Future Roadmap

### Immediate Goals (Next 3 months)
- Complete Supabase integration for production data storage
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Create modular architecture for easier contribution and maintenance

### Medium-term Objectives
- Open-source release with comprehensive documentation
- API development for third-party integrations
- Machine learning enhancement for improved scoring accuracy

## Integration Context

This discovery engine serves as the foundational component of a broader influencer marketing ecosystem:

- **Frontend Applications**: Separate projects handle data visualization and campaign management interfaces
- **ICP Analysis Tools**: Independent modules handle brand Ideal Customer Profile breakdown and matching
- **Campaign Management**: Additional systems manage outreach, negotiations, and performance tracking

The modular design ensures that this core discovery functionality remains focused and maintainable while supporting diverse use cases across the broader platform.
